## Background
### What's that
- **Git** - A way of doing version control for files.
- **Version Control** – A way of tracking changes to files and know what is the most recent.

### Structure
- Can be done totally locally but often uses a central repository (repo) so it is easier to collaborate.
- Each system has its own repository which is a complete history of the changes that have been committed and can synchronize one system’s repo with the central repo.
